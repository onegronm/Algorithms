# Write a function fib() that takes an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number
# The Fibonacci series is a numerical series where each item is the sum of the two previous items.
# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

# time complexity: O(log n) WRONG! each call makes two more calls. This is exponential growth. O(2^n)
# space O(n) how deep do we go in the call stack? depth of tree is proportional to n so O(n)

#f(2) 3
#f(1) f(0)

#f(3) = 5
#f(2) f(1)
#f(1) f(0)

#f(4) = 15 (2^4) = 16
#f(3) f(2)
#f(2) f(1) f(1) f(0)
#f(1) f(0) f(0) f(0) f(0) f(0) f(0) f(0)

# the number of function calls doubles with each level. Each call to fib() makes two more calls.
# this forms a binary tree where number of nodes is 2^n

def fib(n):

	if n <= 0:
		return 0
	elif n == 1:

#print(fib(6)) # 8
#print(fib(7)) # 13


# how can we avoid doing repeat work? Test using a dictionary. If we have already calculated the value
# of f(n), return it. Requires iterative method? How else could we keep dictionary in scope? By passing reference or
# wrapping fib() in a class with an instance variable where we store the answer for any n that we compute:
# this technique of keeping a record (usually in a dictionary) so a function doesnÂ´t run again for the same inputs
# is called MEMOIZATION
# Memoization is a common strategy for dynamic programming problems, which are problems where the solution is composed of solutions to the same problem with smaller inputs (as with the Fibonacci problem, above)

# time complexity: O(n)
# space: O(n) by dict + O(n) from occupying space in the call stack = O(n)

# can this be done in O(1) space? Can we avoid the extra space expense from one or both?
